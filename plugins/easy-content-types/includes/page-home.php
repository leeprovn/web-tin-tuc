					<h3>What are Custom Post Types</h3>
					<p>Custom post types are a way for you to logically organize the content within your WordPress powered website. Rather than simply filing all of your content into differently categorized posts or pages, custom post types allow you to define easy-to-understand "sections" of your website, such as Books, Music, Podcasts, etc.</p>

					<h3>What are Custom Taxonomies</h3>
					<p>Custom Taxonomies act very similar to the default Categories or Post Tags, with one major distinction: they can be named whatever you choose, allowing you to define an organization system that makes sense for your website. For example, if you run an online music catalog, it would make sense for you be able to organize your products into Genres, Years, and Country; and then each of those into further levels of distinction, such as Hard Rock, Pop, and Classical.</p>

					<h3>What are Custom Meta Boxes</h3>
					<p>Custom Metaboxes are sets of additional editable fields that may be added to posts, page, and any custom post type. The fields contained within the meta boxes can be used to store any kind of data you choose. They're often used for image thumbnails, portfolio links, author bios, etc. The types of fields that may be included at: single line text inputs, large text areas, checkboxes, radio button groups, and drop down select menus.</p>

					<h3>Theme Templates for Custom Content Types</h3>
					<p>By separating a site's content into different custom post types, it makes things much easier to organize and understand. Included with the custom post types, are customizable theme templates that are used to display the post types on the front end of the website. This means that you can have one post type displayed in one manner, while another post type is displayed in a completely different way. Everything from layout to colors.</p>
